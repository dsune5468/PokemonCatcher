<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    This is my description
    The game is about a character named Ash who is trying to collect his lost pokemon that Team Rocket stole. Team rocket flies in the sky dropping Ashes pokemons, Ash has to catch his falling pokemon with poke balls before they hit the ground. If he canâ€™t catch 10 pokemons before hitting the floor then he will lose the game. Team Rocket will also start to shoot lightning bolt and if Ash gets hit with it, he loses 10 health point.The game would be controlled by the keyboard.  Either the arrow keys or W,A,S,D keys can be used to move the character.  This game is a type of side scroller game.  Some of the challenges in the game would be to avoid being hit by the falling pokemon and the lightning bolts.  You would win the game after catching a certain amount of pokemon to collect a certain amount of points.  In order to lose the game Ash would have to lose all his health or after 10 pokemon hit the ground the game would end.
